## cgan - a simple GAN written in c (with only libc).

**Quick Start:**
```
   git clone https://github.com/kurdsf/cgan.git && cd cgan && make unzip && make release && ./cgan
```

The goal of the project is to generate MNIST Digits with 
a GAN.

Currently we only implemented a simple neural network with only 
forward propagation.

This project in WIP and is only a toy project.
