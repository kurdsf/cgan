## cgan - a simple GAN written in C 
**ATTENTION:** This project is currently WIP.

### Requirements
This project uses the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). 
Installation instructions can be found [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/#downloading).
This project only works under linux and requires make.

### Quick Start
```bash 
        git clone https://github.com/kurdsf/cgan.git 
        && cd cgan 
        && make unzip
        && make 
```

The goal of the project is to generate MNIST Digits with 
a [GAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network).

The MNIST Dataset we use is taken from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/open-datasets/dataset-mnist?tabs=azure-storage).

Currently we only implemented a simple neural network '''library'''.
