## cgan - a simple gan written in c (with only libc).
**Important Note**: You need to unzip data.zip before you 
can run the program.

The goal of the project is to generate MNIST Digits with 
a GAN.

Currently we only implemented a simple neural network with only 
forward propagation.

This project in WIP and is only a toy project.
